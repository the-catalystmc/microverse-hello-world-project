# microverse-hello-world-project
Hello Microverse project that contains a HTML with an header and a css file that colors the header.
This project is part of an activity that helps me to get aquainted with the GitHub flow, Linters and pull requests. The project was made using the HTML and CSS languages. These technologies were used because the project was a webpage with a title. I then had to add a .gitignore file that ignored the files I did not want to upload. A challenge faced was the styling that was required in the CSS file.

Built With
HTML & CSS

Getting Started
There are no installations required. Simply download the files and open the index.html to open the webpage.
